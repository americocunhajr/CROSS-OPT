**CROSS-OPT: Cross-Entropy Optimization for Truss Structures** is a Matlab package that implements a framework for size and shape structural optimization of truss systems. The package leverages the Cross-Entropy (CE) method for global search optimization and employs an augmented Lagrangian formulation to handle equality and inequality constraints. With some straightforward adaptations, the CROSS-OPT strategy can also be applied to other structural systems and optimization problems. More details are in the following paper:
